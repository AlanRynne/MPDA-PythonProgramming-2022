# Class structure

---

- Theory (30min aprox?)
- Class exercises (rest of the class)
- Homework

## Theory

- We'll only be touching the basics of `python`
  - More than enough to create complex script.
- We'll be doing some math
  - nothing that won't be covered in your math classes already.

## Class exercises

In each lesson, we will do some class exercises to understand the concepts.

- Some exercises would be a walkthrough made by the teachers.
- Others will be a challenge for you to complete in class.

You are encouraged to work in small teams (2-3 students) if you find it helpful.

---

### Questions?

> There are no dumb questions in this class!

Meaning... do not hesitate to ask if something is unclear or doesn't seem right.

If you have a question, chances are other students have it too!

## Homework

Every week you will have an assignment to deliver.

Unless otherwise specified, the deadline for each assignment will be the day of the next Python class.

## Homework

Although your assignments will be graded individually, you are encouraged to work in small teams if you find it helpful.

# Problem solving

---

- When you are having an error in your script, please try to be descriptive.

:::incremental

- Try to share clear screenshots of what is happening.
- Test your file in someone elses computer, does it work?
- Whenever possible, try to put your questions/problems in the Discord channel so all students can benefit.
